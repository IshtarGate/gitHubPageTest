                    "It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle — they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments." - Alfred North Whitehead

                <h3>A Dream Within a Dream</h3>
                <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!
                    And, in parting from you now,
                    Thus much let me avow —
                    You are not wrong, who deem
                    That my days have been a dream;
                    Yet if hope has flown away
                    In a night, or in a day,
                    In a vision, or in none,
                    Is it therefore the less gone?
                    <strong>All that we see or seem
                    Is but a dream within a dream.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stand amid the roar
                    Of a surf-tormented shore,
                    And I hold within my hand
                    Grains of the golden sand —
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,
                    While I weep — while I weep!
                    O God! Can I not grasp
                    Them with a tighter clasp?
                    O God! can I not save
                    One from the pitiless wave?
                    Is all that we see or seem
                    But a dream within a dream?
                </p>
